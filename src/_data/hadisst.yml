name: hadley met centre sea surface temperature data

variable: sea surface temperature

description: Global sea ice and sea surface temperature 

url: http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisst/

download_instructions: You will most likely want to download the netcdf version of the file <HadISST_sst.nc.gz> if you would like to have the raw, monthly average sea surface temperature values. 

associated_data_packages: hadsstr

timespan:
  - start: 1871
  - end: 1995

spatial_coverage: global

spatial_bounding_lat: -90 - 90

spatial_bounding_lon: -180 - 180

spatial_resolution: 1 degree latitude-longitude

temporal_resolution: monthly

temporal_continuous: no

spatial_continuous: yes

spatial_discontinuity: "Users have noticed that there is a minor discontinuity at the dateline in HadISST1 SST fields starting in 1982. It appears to only affect gridcells just to the east of the dateline. Please note that this can affect estimates of the mean and variability of SSTs in HadISST1 when analysed across this region."

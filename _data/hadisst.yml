name: Hadley met centre sea surface temperature data

variable: sea surface temperature

description: Historical and current global sea ice and sea surface temperature gridded dataset. Missing data were interpolated using a model reconstruction. For details see Rayner et al. 2003.

download_instructions: You will most likely want to download the netcdf version of the file <HadISST_sst.nc.gz> if you would like to have the raw, monthly average sea surface temperature values.

spatial_discontinuity: "Users have noticed that there is a minor discontinuity at the dateline in HadISST1 SST fields starting in 1982. It appears to only affect gridcells just to the east of the dateline. Please note that this can affect estimates of the mean and variability of SSTs in HadISST1 when analysed across this region."
